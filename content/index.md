# Bōken

_冒険_ means Adventurer

## Introduction

A TTRPG, or Tabletop Role-Playing Game, is a type of game where players assume the roles of fictional characters and collaboratively create a story. These games are typically played around a table or online, using rulebooks, dice, and the imagination of the players.

### Why Bōken?

Attribute-Based Progression: Character growth is directly tied to in-game actions, with attributes improving through use and failure, promoting a dynamic development path.
Grit System: A unique health and endurance system that goes beyond simple hit points, adding a strategic layer to combat and survival.
Dynamic Inventory: A realistic inventory system with slots and encumbrance that affects gameplay, encouraging strategic management of resources.
Magic Through Words of Power: A flexible and creative magic system where spells are crafted from combining Words of Power, allowing for personalized and situation-specific spells.
Risk and Reward Mechanics: The game emphasizes strategic risk-taking, where critical failures and successes have significant impacts on character progression and story development.
Usage and Conditions: Items and gear have usage points and conditions, adding a layer of realism and tactical depth to equipment management.
Narrative Integration: The rules encourage storytelling and role-playing, with mechanics that support narrative outcomes and character-driven stories.

### The World of Bōken

The air is thick with the stench of decay, as the sun sets over a world plunged into darkness. The forests are filled
with malevolent spirits, seeking to prey upon the living. In this world, might is right, and only the strongest
survive. The people who call this place home are hardened by years of violence and strife. They know that the shadows
hold secrets, and that the night brings with it unspeakable horrors. Yet despite the danger, they refuse to give in
to despair. For them, every day is a struggle to survive, and every victory a triumph over the forces of evil that
seek to consume them. Welcome to the world of dark fantasy, where the lines between good and evil are blurred, and
the only certainty is that the darkness will always seek to swallow the light.

## Making an Adventurer

The world is unfair and cruel. The wilderness is hazardous, and the cities are a bit safer. Adventurers brave the land looking to make their name by facing the world's evils.

### Attributes

_Your attributes describe your adventure._

**STR:** Physical prowess and power

**DEX:** Nimbleness and finesse

**CON:** Toughness and resilience

**INT:** Knowledge and deduction

**WIL:** Intuition and sense

**CHA:** Presence and force of will

When creating your adventurer you have 4d4s, and 2d6s to allocate in between your six attributes.

> Cost per dice 1d4 1pt, 1d6 2pts, 1d8 4pts, 1d10 8pts, 1d12 16pts

#### Improvement

> Improvement can be made on attributes during play. When a save is critically failed you mark that attribute. The next time you rest you can roll that attribute. On a 1 mark a pip. Once you get to the maximum number of the attribute, the attribute grows a size. Ex: if your attribute is a d4 you’ll need 4 pips to upgrade from a d4 to a d6. Then you’ll need 6 pip to upgrade to a d8. And so on.

### Grit, background & wealth

Roll 2d6 drop the lowest for your Grit. This is the damage your adventurer can shrug off before taking serious harm.

Roll or choose a Background from the chart. This is what you were doing when the call for adventure hit you.

Your wealth is determined by your background and is gaged via Usage Dice.

### Backgrounds

> ToDo: Add a table with backgrounds

## How to play

_Para nosotros, los TTRPG son conversaciones entre el GM y los jugadores, en las que el GM presenta una situación y los jugadores responden con sus personajes. El GM luego narra las consecuencias que llevan a la próxima situación, y así se avanza en la historia._

### Role Play

Como jugadores asimismo el Rol de nuestros personajes, reaccionando y actuando como tu personaje lo haría. Podes narrar lo que hace tu personaje o hablar como si fueras tu personaje.

Best Practices

- Hace preguntas. Toma notas. Dibuja mapas.
- Trabaja en equipo. Planeen. Hagan aliados.
- Los dados son un riesgo. Si tenes un plan podes evitar tiradas.
- Intenta ganar. Disfruta fallar. Récorda fallar.
- Pelea sucio. Rendite. Corre y si la muerte se acerca, hace la épica!

### Saves

Cuando tu personaje quiere hacer algo con un resultado riesgoso o incierto, Tiras una salvación del atributo relacionado con la actividad. _(Roll under o roll above)_

**Opposed Saves:** cuando competís contra otra criatura las dos tiran salvaciones y se comparan.

**Advantage**: Cuando una situación se gire a tu favor tiras dos dados y te quedas con el mejor.

**Disadvantage**: Cuando una situación se gire en tu contra tiras dos dados y te quedas con el peor.

### Combate

_El combate nunca es deseable y debería evitarse, aún así no siempre se puede._

Si se logra encontrar un enemigo desprevenido, el enemigo está sorprendido. Sino todos los que entran en combate tiran una salvación de WIS y se organizan los turnos.

Cada turno los Personajes pueden moverse y tomar una acción. Una acción puede ser negociar, atacar, escapar o probar una gambeta.

(Algo con estrategia y cambiar orden)

**Ataques** en combate los personajes tiran el dado de si arma. Si el dado sale 1 el ataque falla, sino el dado indica el daño. Este se ve reducido por armadura (si tiene). El resto reduce [Grit].

#### Heridas, Condiciones y Muerte

### [GRIT]

[Grit] representa la habilidad de un personaje de resistir golpes. Una vez que perdes todo tu [Grit] recibis una carta de herix por cada daño. Si no podes recivir mas heridas, tu personaje muere.

### Rest and Healing

Hay tres tipos de descansos.

- Corto: Recuperas 1 [Grit]
- Largo: Recuperas 1d6+1 [Grit] por una racion.
- Completo: Recuperas todo tu [Grit] y podes tirar progresso de Attributo.

## Magic

Magic is a rare occurrence in the world, does who can use it are regarded as powerful beings to be respected, feared or even worshipped. The secrets of magic is tightly guarded and almost forgotten and buried deep into the wilderness. The few who know the words of power can channel their mana to cast spells. Masters can weave multiple words to create powerful effects.

To be able to cast a spell you need to know at least one word of power, you should also have the mana points to cast it and then roll an [INT] save to see if you can control the spell. Control works as a range:

- If you roll under the control number/s you misscast the spell and you take a mana burn.
- If you roll the control number/s you cast the spell as intended.
- If you roll over the control number/s you overcast the spell may have extra effects.

### Words of Power

Words of power are writen in the ancient language of the gods. They are the building blocks of magic. The more words you know the more powerful spells you can cast.

Here is a list of words of power:

- Absorb
- Armor
- Arrow
- Bind
- Blade
- Blood
- Blossom
- Bolt
- Bone
- Burn
- Crystal
- Duplicate
- Echo
- Fade
- Flame
- Hand
- Heal
- Jar
- Light
- Shield
- Thorn
- Whip
- Wither
- Wood

<!-- The concept of Words of Power offers a canvas for creativity and depth in spellcasting. Here’s a simple yet dynamic framework:

Discovery and Learning: Magic users begin with a few basic Words of Power and can discover more through exploration, study, or interaction with mystical entities. Each word holds a specific element or concept, such as Fire, Water, Mind, Time, etc.
Combination Spells: Players create spells by combining Words of Power. The order and selection of words affect the spell's outcome, allowing for a vast array of effects. For example, combining "Fire" and "Arrow" might create a flaming projectile, while "Silence" and "Mind" could yield a spell that blocks magical detection.
Power Scaling: The strength of a spell is determined by the magic user's proficiency and the number of words combined. More words can create more powerful effects but also increase the difficulty and the risk of failure.
Mana and Exhaustion: Spellcasting consumes mana or causes exhaustion. More complex spells require more resources, adding a strategic layer to magic use.
Environmental Effects: The environment can influence magic, making some spells stronger or weaker. This encourages players to engage with their surroundings and plan their spellcasting strategically.
Rituals and Artifacts: Some spells or effects might require rituals, specific conditions, or artifacts. This can drive adventure and exploration as players seek out rare components or seek to fulfill conditions for powerful magic.

Mana System
Mana Reserve: Each magic user has a Mana Reserve that reflects their capacity to wield magic. This reserve is a numerical value that depletes as spells are cast and replenishes over time or through specific actions.
Absorption Rate: This rate determines how quickly a magic user can replenish their Mana Reserve from their surroundings or through meditation. Factors like environment, magical artifacts, or ley lines could enhance absorption.
Mana Control: Reflects the skill level of the magic user in handling complex spells without losing control. Higher Mana Control allows for combining more Words of Power effectively, casting spells with greater precision, and reducing the risk of spell failure or backlash.
Integrating Grit
Desperate Casts: Allow magic users to tap into their Grit as a last resort to cast spells when Mana is low. This represents drawing on their physical reserves and determination to fuel their magic, emphasizing the dangerous nature of such acts.
Empowering Spells: Grit can be voluntarily expended to enhance the potency of spells, increasing effects like damage, duration, or area of effect. This should be a tactical choice, weighing the immediate benefits of a powerful spell against the potential physical repercussions.
Grit Recovery: Introduce rituals or magical potions that recover Grit but might require rare components or specific conditions, making them valuable but not easily accessible.
Words of Power Mechanism
Let's incorporate your words into a system that encourages creativity and tactical thinking:

Basic Combos: Start by defining basic combinations of words that result in straightforward spells. For example:

Advanced Combos: Introduce the concept of advanced spells that require a higher level of Mana Control and possibly more words. For example:

Duplicate + Blade + Thorn = Creates multiple thorned blades that orbit the caster, attacking nearby enemies.
Absorb + Crystal + Light = A spell that absorbs light to fill a crystal, which can then be used as a source of illumination or to blind enemies.

Environmental and Situational Modifiers: Spells can have different effects based on the environment or the situation. For instance, a Blossom spell could have healing properties in a forest but become toxic in a swamp.

Ritual Spells: For powerful effects, require a combination of specific Words of Power, Mana, Grit, and environmental conditions to perform a ritual. This could involve creating protective wards, summoning creatures, or changing the weather.

Grit as a Catalyst: For spells that push beyond the caster's limits, Grit can act as a catalyst, increasing the spell's power but at a personal risk. For example, using Flame + Whip + Grit could create a devastating inferno whip that also burns the caster, reducing Grit but dealing massive damage.

Attributes for Words of Power
Offensive (Damage): The base damage a word can inflict. For example, "Burn" could have a higher base damage compared to "Bolt." This attribute is crucial for spells intended to harm or destroy.

Defensive (Protection): The amount of damage or number of attacks a spell can absorb before dissipating. "Shield" might offer high defensive value, whereas "Armor" provides moderate, but longer-lasting, protection.

Effect (Utility): Describes the range of non-damaging effects a word can produce, such as healing, buffing, debuffing, or altering the environment. "Heal" restores health, "Blossom" could encourage growth or healing over an area, and "Wither" might weaken enemies or structures.

Cost (Mana Consumption): Indicates how much Mana is required to cast the spell. More powerful words or combinations thereof could have a higher Mana cost, balancing their use in gameplay.

Control (Precision): A measure of how easy or difficult it is to cast a spell without unintended consequences. This could be represented by a target number or range. Spells with high damage or powerful effects might have tighter control ranges, making them riskier to cast.

Mana Burn (Risk): A unique effect that triggers on a misspell or when Grit powers a spell. This could result in additional damage to the caster, a backlash effect, or a wild magic surge that produces unpredictable outcomes. Mana Burn adds an element of risk to using powerful spells or relying on Grit.

Implementing Attributes in Gameplay
Balancing Spells: The interaction between these attributes allows for a wide range of spells with varied strategic uses. For example, a low-cost, high-control spell like "Light" could be useful for exploration without risking Mana Burn, whereas a high-cost, low-control spell like "Flame + Whip" would be a powerful combat move with significant risk.

Strategic Choices: Players must make strategic decisions about when to use certain spells based on their Mana reserves, the situation's demands, and the potential risks of Mana Burn. This adds depth to magic use in the game.

Spell Crafting: Players can craft spells by combining Words of Power, considering the cumulative attributes of the chosen words. A spell combining "Burn + Arrow" might have a moderate offensive rating and cost, with a specific control range to avoid Mana Burn.

Critical Casts and Misspells: The Control attribute introduces a skill element to spellcasting, where players can aim for Critical Casts for enhanced effects or risk Misspells with negative consequences. This could be influenced by character abilities, magical items, or environmental factors.

Mana and Grit Management: Players must manage their Mana and Grit carefully, balancing the need for powerful spells with the risk of depleting these resources. Choosing when to use Grit to empower a spell adds a layer of tactical decision-making, especially in dire situations.

This system encourages players to engage deeply with the magic mechanics, making spellcasting a dynamic and integral part of the Bōken experience. Players will need to think carefully about their choices, adapt to the outcomes of their spells, and explore the world to discover new Words of Power and combinations. -->

### Example Spell

Fade:
• Solo cast: Renders the caster or an object invisible for [Int] rounds or until the caster attacks.
• Effect: Targets can’t make save against the spell or add Avg[Int]
• Cost: 2
• Control: 4-6
• Failure: _Your eyes fade, making you blind_ You gain the [Blind] condition for [Int] rounds.
• Overcast: _Your body fades, making you invisible_ Your target and all their attack become invisible for [Int] rounds.
• Mana Burn: If failed, the spell partially works, making shadows or silhouettes visible to keen observers.

### Signature Spells

Signature spells are the discovery by a magic user of a unique combination of words that only they can cast. These spells are usually more powerful, cost less mana and have unique effects but tend to be more difficult to control.

Ex:

1. Absorb, Blade, Crystal = Gilban's Prismatic Saber:

2. Bind, Bolt, Bone = Otomund's Lich Grasp:

3. Burn, Hand, Heal = Phoenix's Embrace:

4. Jar, Light, Shield = Lantern of Hoping Light:

5. Thorn, Wither, Wood = Nature's Wrath:
