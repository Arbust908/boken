### The World of Bōken

A land shrouded in shadow, where the remnants of a once bright world struggle against the tide of darkness. Here, ancient evils stir in the deep woods, and spirits haunt the ruins of forgotten realms. It's a world where the line between heroism and survival is thin, and legends are born from the deeds of those who dare to challenge the darkness. Welcome to a place where every victory is etched with the scars of sacrifice, and the light of hope is a precious flame guarded by the few against the many.

> The rules and mechanics are designed for a dark world, low fantasy, and high risk. The world is a dangerous place, and the players will need to be smart, resourceful, and lucky to survive.
> Still a creative GM can tweak some of the numbers and rules to change the theme and tone of the game.

## Making an Adventurer

The world is unfair and cruel. The wilderness is hazardous, and the cities are a bit safer. Adventurers brave the land looking to make their name by facing the world's evils.

### Attributes

_Your attributes describe your adventure._

**Strength** [STR]: The might of your arms and the force of your resolve.

**Dexterity** [DEX]: The grace of your movements and the precision of your actions.

**Constitution** [CON]: Your endurance, your fortitude—the wellspring of your vitality.

**Intelligence** [INT]: The depth of your knowledge and the acuity of your mind.

**Wisdom** [WIS]: The strength of your spirit and the clarity of your intuition.

**Charisma** [CHA]: The force of your presence and the power of your words.

When creating your adventurer you have 4d4s, and 2d6s to allocate in between your six attributes.

<!-- > Cost per dice 1d4 1pt, 1d6 2pts, 1d8 4pts, 1d10 8pts, 1d12 16pts -->

<!-- #### Improvement

> Improvement can be made on attributes during play. When a save is critically failed you mark that attribute. The next time you rest you can roll that attribute. On a 1 mark a pip. Once you get to the maximum number of the attribute, the attribute grows a size. Ex: if your attribute is a d4 you’ll need 4 pips to upgrade from a d4 to a d6. Then you’ll need 6 pip to upgrade to a d8. And so on. -->

### Grit, background & wealth

Roll 2d6 drop the lowest for your Grit. This is the damage your adventurer can shrug off before taking serious harm.

Roll or choose a Background from the chart. This is what you were doing when the call for adventure hit you.

Your wealth is determined by your background and is gaged via Usage Dice.

## Starting equipment

You start your adventure with Torches, Rations, and whatever your Background gives you.

### Details

You can give your adventure its details but I’m if you need inspiration or preference to leave the details to luck you can use the table below.

<!-- ToDo: Add a table with details -->

## Inventory

### **Inventory slots**

The inventory is managed with _slots_, where the objects occupy one and if they are larger they can occupy more than one. Equipped items have special slots.

### Hands

What one has in one's hands or within their reach.

### Body

What you carry on your body, hanging or wearing.

### Bag

Which is in places that are more difficult to reach in combat.

### **Encumbrance**

When you have more than the _slots_ you can, you cannot run and your rolls have [DIS]

### **Conditions**

When you receive damage or some negative effect they occupy _slots_. The conditions say how they can be removed. An adventurer can have multiple copies of a condition.

### **Banking**

When you are in a safe city you can find establishments to deposit money and/or objects that you want to keep or not lose.
Depending on the establishment and what you deposit, the cost may be fixed or a percentage.

### **Usage**

Most items have three points of use. When all three are marked the item is broken or consumed. Broken items can be repaired.

#### **Weapons, Armor and Ammunition**

After each combat where it was used, you roll a `d6`. On a 5 or 6 you mark a dot.

#### **Flashlights and Torches**

You score a point every 6 turns.

#### **Rations and Liquids**

Marks every time you use it.

Other items will have their marks and rules.

## How to play

_For us, TTRPGs are conversations between the GM and the players, in which the GM presents a situation and the players respond with their characters. The GM then narrates the consequences that lead to the next situation, and thus the story advances._

### Role Play

As players we also play the role of our characters, reacting and acting as your character would. You can narrate what your character does or speak as if you were your character.

Best Practices

- Ask away. Jot things down. Sketch out maps.
- Team up. Make plans. Ally up.
- Dice are a gamble. Got a plan? Dodge those rolls.
- Aim to win. Love the fails. Embrace the flops.
- Fight dirty.

### Saves

When your character wants to do something with a risky or uncertain outcome, you roll a save from the attribute related to the activity. _(Roll under o roll above)_

**Opposed Saves:** When competing against another creature both roll saves and compare each other.

**Advantage** [Adv]: When a situation turns in your favor, you roll two dice and keep the best one.

**Disadvantage** [Dis]: When a situation turns against you, you roll two dice and take the worst one.

### Combat

_Combat is never desirable and should be avoided, yet it is not always possible._

If you manage to find an unsuspecting enemy, the enemy is surprised. Otherwise, everyone who enters combat rolls a WIS save and the turns are organized.

Each turn the Characters can move and take an action. An action can be negotiating, attacking, escaping or trying a trick.

(Something with strategy and changing order)

**Attacks** In combat the characters roll the dice for their weapon. If the die rolls 1 the attack fails, otherwise the die indicates the damage. This is reduced by armor (if you have it). The rest reduce [Grit].

#### Injuries, Conditions and Death

When you lose all your [Grit] you receive a wound card for each damage. If you cannot receive any more wounds, your character dies.

##### Conditions

- **Blind**: You cannot see. You have [Dis] on all your actions.
- **Bleeding**: You roll a [CON] save at the end of each turn. If you fail you receive a wound.
- **Winded**: During your turn you can move or attack, not both.
- **Stunned**: You lose your next turn.

### Grit

[Grit] represents a character's ability to resist hits. Once you lose all your [Grit] you receive a wound card for each damage. If you cannot receive any more wounds, your character dies.

### Rest and Healing

There are three types of breaks.

- Short: You recover 1 [Grit]
- Long: You recover 1d6+1 [Grit] for one ration.
- Complete: You recover all your [Grit] _and can roll Attribute progress_.

## Magic

Magic is a rare occurrence in the world, does who can use it are regarded as powerful beings to be respected, feared or even worshipped. The secrets of magic is tightly guarded and almost forgotten and buried deep into the wilderness. The few who know the words of power can channel their mana to cast spells. Masters can weave multiple words to create powerful effects.

To be able to cast a spell you need to know at least one word of power, you should also have the mana points to cast it and then roll an [INT] save to see if you can control the spell. Control works as a range:

- If you roll under the control number/s you miscast the spell and you take a mana burn.
- If you roll the control number/s you cast the spell as intended.
- If you roll over the control number/s you overcast the spell may have extra effects.

### Words of Power

Words of power are written in the ancient language of the gods. They are the building blocks of magic. The more words you know the more powerful spells you can cast.

Here is a list of words of power:

- Absorb
- Armor
- Arrow
- Bind
- Blade
- Blood
- Blossom
- Bolt
- Bone
- Burn
- Crystal
- Duplicate
- Echo
- Fade
- Flame
- Hand
- Heal
- Jar
- Light
- Shield
- Thorn
- Whip
- Wither
- Wood

<!-- The concept of Words of Power offers a canvas for creativity and depth in spellcasting. Here’s a simple yet dynamic framework:

Discovery and Learning: Magic users begin with a few basic Words of Power and can discover more through exploration, study, or interaction with mystical entities. Each word holds a specific element or concept, such as Fire, Water, Mind, Time, etc.
Combination Spells: Players create spells by combining Words of Power. The order and selection of words affect the spell's outcome, allowing for a vast array of effects. For example, combining "Fire" and "Arrow" might create a flaming projectile, while "Silence" and "Mind" could yield a spell that blocks magical detection.
Power Scaling: The strength of a spell is determined by the magic user's proficiency and the number of words combined. More words can create more powerful effects but also increase the difficulty and the risk of failure.
Mana and Exhaustion: Spellcasting consumes mana or causes exhaustion. More complex spells require more resources, adding a strategic layer to magic use.
Environmental Effects: The environment can influence magic, making some spells stronger or weaker. This encourages players to engage with their surroundings and plan their spellcasting strategically.
Rituals and Artifacts: Some spells or effects might require rituals, specific conditions, or artifacts. This can drive adventure and exploration as players seek out rare components or seek to fulfill conditions for powerful magic.

Mana System
Mana Reserve: Each magic user has a Mana Reserve that reflects their capacity to wield magic. This reserve is a numerical value that depletes as spells are cast and replenishes over time or through specific actions.
Absorption Rate: This rate determines how quickly a magic user can replenish their Mana Reserve from their surroundings or through meditation. Factors like environment, magical artifacts, or ley lines could enhance absorption.
Mana Control: Reflects the skill level of the magic user in handling complex spells without losing control. Higher Mana Control allows for combining more Words of Power effectively, casting spells with greater precision, and reducing the risk of spell failure or backlash.
Integrating Grit
Desperate Casts: Allow magic users to tap into their Grit as a last resort to cast spells when Mana is low. This represents drawing on their physical reserves and determination to fuel their magic, emphasizing the dangerous nature of such acts.
Empowering Spells: Grit can be voluntarily expended to enhance the potency of spells, increasing effects like damage, duration, or area of effect. This should be a tactical choice, weighing the immediate benefits of a powerful spell against the potential physical repercussions.
Grit Recovery: Introduce rituals or magical potions that recover Grit but might require rare components or specific conditions, making them valuable but not easily accessible.
Words of Power Mechanism
Let's incorporate your words into a system that encourages creativity and tactical thinking:

Basic Combos: Start by defining basic combinations of words that result in straightforward spells. For example:

Advanced Combos: Introduce the concept of advanced spells that require a higher level of Mana Control and possibly more words. For example:

Duplicate + Blade + Thorn = Creates multiple thorned blades that orbit the caster, attacking nearby enemies.
Absorb + Crystal + Light = A spell that absorbs light to fill a crystal, which can then be used as a source of illumination or to blind enemies.

Environmental and Situational Modifiers: Spells can have different effects based on the environment or the situation. For instance, a Blossom spell could have healing properties in a forest but become toxic in a swamp.

Ritual Spells: For powerful effects, require a combination of specific Words of Power, Mana, Grit, and environmental conditions to perform a ritual. This could involve creating protective wards, summoning creatures, or changing the weather.

Grit as a Catalyst: For spells that push beyond the caster's limits, Grit can act as a catalyst, increasing the spell's power but at a personal risk. For example, using Flame + Whip + Grit could create a devastating inferno whip that also burns the caster, reducing Grit but dealing massive damage.

Attributes for Words of Power
Offensive (Damage): The base damage a word can inflict. For example, "Burn" could have a higher base damage compared to "Bolt." This attribute is crucial for spells intended to harm or destroy.

Defensive (Protection): The amount of damage or number of attacks a spell can absorb before dissipating. "Shield" might offer high defensive value, whereas "Armor" provides moderate, but longer-lasting, protection.

Effect (Utility): Describes the range of non-damaging effects a word can produce, such as healing, buffing, debuffing, or altering the environment. "Heal" restores health, "Blossom" could encourage growth or healing over an area, and "Wither" might weaken enemies or structures.

Cost (Mana Consumption): Indicates how much Mana is required to cast the spell. More powerful words or combinations thereof could have a higher Mana cost, balancing their use in gameplay.

Control (Precision): A measure of how easy or difficult it is to cast a spell without unintended consequences. This could be represented by a target number or range. Spells with high damage or powerful effects might have tighter control ranges, making them riskier to cast.

Mana Burn (Risk): A unique effect that triggers on a misspell or when Grit powers a spell. This could result in additional damage to the caster, a backlash effect, or a wild magic surge that produces unpredictable outcomes. Mana Burn adds an element of risk to using powerful spells or relying on Grit.

Implementing Attributes in Gameplay
Balancing Spells: The interaction between these attributes allows for a wide range of spells with varied strategic uses. For example, a low-cost, high-control spell like "Light" could be useful for exploration without risking Mana Burn, whereas a high-cost, low-control spell like "Flame + Whip" would be a powerful combat move with significant risk.

Strategic Choices: Players must make strategic decisions about when to use certain spells based on their Mana reserves, the situation's demands, and the potential risks of Mana Burn. This adds depth to magic use in the game.

Spell Crafting: Players can craft spells by combining Words of Power, considering the cumulative attributes of the chosen words. A spell combining "Burn + Arrow" might have a moderate offensive rating and cost, with a specific control range to avoid Mana Burn.

Critical Casts and Misspells: The Control attribute introduces a skill element to spellcasting, where players can aim for Critical Casts for enhanced effects or risk Misspells with negative consequences. This could be influenced by character abilities, magical items, or environmental factors.

Mana and Grit Management: Players must manage their Mana and Grit carefully, balancing the need for powerful spells with the risk of depleting these resources. Choosing when to use Grit to empower a spell adds a layer of tactical decision-making, especially in dire situations.

This system encourages players to engage deeply with the magic mechanics, making spellcasting a dynamic and integral part of the Bōken experience. Players will need to think carefully about their choices, adapt to the outcomes of their spells, and explore the world to discover new Words of Power and combinations. -->

### Example Spell

Fade:
• Solo cast: Renders the caster or an object invisible for [Int] rounds or until the caster attacks.
• Effect: Targets can’t make save against the spell or add Avg[Int]
• Cost: 2
• Control: 4-6
• Failure: _Your eyes fade, making you blind_ You gain the [Blind] condition for [Int] rounds.
• Overcast: _Your body fades, making you invisible_ Your target and all their attack become invisible for [Int] rounds.
• Mana Burn: If failed, the spell partially works, making shadows or silhouettes visible to keen observers.

### Signature Spells

Signature spells are the discovery by a magic user of a unique combination of words that only they can cast. These spells are usually more powerful, cost less mana and have unique effects but tend to be more difficult to control.

Ex:

1. Absorb, Blade, Crystal = Gilban's Prismatic Saber:

2. Bind, Bolt, Bone = Otomund's Lich Grasp:

3. Burn, Hand, Heal = Phoenix's Embrace:

4. Jar, Light, Shield = Lantern of Hoping Light:

5. Thorn, Wither, Wood = Nature's Wrath:

## Glossary

- **Save:** A roll to determine the outcome of an action.
- **Avg[Attribute]:** The average of the attribute. ex: Int = d6, Avg[Int] = 3.
- **Max[Attribute]:** The maximum of the attribute. ex: Int = d6, Max[Int] = 6.
-
